    <h2>Sausage and Sauerkraut</h2>
    <p>This sauerkraut and sausage recipe is from a sweet old German lady I used to attend church with. Allow for plenty of time to prepare and cook this dish.</p>
    <p>It is definitely worth the time and effort! Serve with hot German potato salad and red cabbage.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds sauerkraut, rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon caraway seeds (Optional)</li>
        <li>¼ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 apple, diced</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>½ pound bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds kielbasa sausage, cut into 1-inch thick slices</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place sauerkraut, caraway seeds, brown sugar, and apple into a large saucepan over medium-low heat, and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low, and cook for 2 hours, stirring occasionally. </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. </li>
        <li>Place bacon and onion into a skillet over medium heat, and cook until bacon is almost crisp and onion is beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Stir the bacon mixture into the sauerkraut. </li>
        <li>Brown kielbasa sausage in remaining bacon grease in the same skillet until sausage begins to brown, 10 to 15 minutes; stir into the sauerkraut mixture. </li>
        <li>Spoon the sauerkraut and sausage mixture into the prepared baking dish. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 1 hour. </li>
    </ol>
